# deepfake-audio-classifier
This is the repository for the final project of CS 545: Machine Learning for Signal Processing 

Description of files:
1. Baseline_models: contains code for the baseline RandomForest and MLP classifiers and their test results
2. End2End_Models: contains code for running the pretrained End2End model against test data
3. Feature_extraction-final: Code for extracting MFCC, LFCC, Mel-spectrogram for given audio samples
4. metrics.py: EER, AUC, ROC calculation related functions
5. modeldropout.py: Our main ResNet based model code
6. Training: Script for training and evaluating the model
7. Testing: Script for testing against generated samples
